# aws-network-firewall-cfn-example
AWS Network Firewall Cloudformation Example

This work is based on the work of https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-networkfirewall-cfn-templates and uses the "distributed_architecture" to keep it a little less complex for this example.

The goal is to show how traceability and auditability can be ensured with an GitOps approach for the AWS Network Firewall and its corresponding rules and policies.
